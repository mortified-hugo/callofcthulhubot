# Shoggoth Helper - A Discord Bot for Call of Cthulhu RPG

Shoggoth Helper is a Discord Bot for the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition tabletop RPG. It's intent is to be a simple tool used to facilitate the Game's Master, known in Call of Cthulhu as the Keeper, to run their game with their team of investigators in any Discord Server. This bot is best paired with other dice rolling bots.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this code you will need: 
1) Install and run Python 3.
2) to get a Discord Bot Token in the Discord Development Portal and save it under a variable DISCORD_TOKEN in a local .env file.
3) to get the third-party libraries listed in requirements.txt.

### Installing

Getting Python 3.

```

Getting Third-Party libraries.

```
Use pip install to install the libraries present in requirements.txt
Some IDEs will provide you with the option to install them already.
```

## Running on Discord

Once you set it up for running in it locally, run bot.py and main.py to get the bot running. You can locally personalize your bot by adding .jpg and .png files to images, add, change and edit rule checklists in rules in .txt and even add unsettling references to the gods folder. Right now, those files are populated with stuff from my personal use, that you can use for testing.
