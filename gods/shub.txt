Ia! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!
Do not worry, human, Castor is dead.
Ever their praises in abundance to the Black Goat.
Sacrifices to the Black Goat are to be put in a stone altar and are usually accepted under moon light.
Mr. Castor and his well-behaved boys are no more.
The Mist had birthed Shub-Niggurath.
Take your time, human, that is not dead which can eternal lie.
