Chase Checklist:

Chase set up:
1) Speed Roll:
- every investigator and NPC on the chase make a CON roll:
-- on success: no change to MOV rating;
-- on extreme success: +1 to MOV;
-- on failure: -1 MOV;
-- if in vehicle, use drive or relevant skill for that skill instead of CON;

2) Compare Speeds:
- Define location and establish map, defining an end point and possible hazards;
- Define DEX order;
- Define Actions:
-- The character/vehicle with the slowest has 1 action
-- Every other character gain movements based on that: Equal is 1, 1 bigger is 2 and so on.

**CHASE**

Players can take the following actions during chase:
- Move one space Forward;
- Initiate Attack (using the relevant skill);
- Cast a spell;
- Other action;

During their turn, an investigator can take as many actions as they have available;
Hazards may be face in the chase.

If chased and chaser are in the same location, conflict may arise
