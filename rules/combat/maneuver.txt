Maneuver checklist:

1 - Compare builds:
-- Smaller initiator (1 penalty die for each point/ If build difference is 3+, maneuver is impossible)
2 - Make an attack roll with Fighting Skill;

3 - Success in a maneuver can be used to:
-- Disarming an opponent;
-- Somehow placing the opponent in a disadvantage (penalty die)
-- Escape when restrained;
-- Pushing a opponent over a cliff or other similar fight ending actions;
