Firearms fight checklist:

1 - DEX Order is affected:
To shoot, you have an advantage of DEX +50 if adversary is not armed with a firearm;

2 - Determine difficulty of the shot:
Bearer can be:
- Within base range: regular difficulty roll
- Long range (up to twice range): hard difficulty roll
- Very long range (more than double the base range): extreme difficulty

3 - Apply modifiers:
- Penalty die if:
-- Shooter in a moving car/plane etc.
-- Target in cover or concealed
-- Fast-moving target;
-- Small target size

- Bonus die if:
-- Big target;
-- Point-blank range;
-- Shooter takes a turn to aim;

* Automatic Fire *

1 - Shooter pulls the trigger in a round (roll firearms ability)
2 - Weapons keep firing;
3 - Determine number of bullets per volley (ability w/ SMG/MG divided by 10, rounded down)
4 - For each volley in a round, a penalty die, until weapon empty or trigger released;

* Malfunctions *

If attack roll results in a number >= malfunction number, the weapon malfuctions:
- if small weapon: reload;
- if large weapon/automatic: jam;
Jams take 1D6 to fix and a successful Mechanical Repair or Firearm skill roll;
Ex.: .45 revolver malfunction number is 100.
