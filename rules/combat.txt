Combat checklist:

- Define order of action with DEX
- Each investigator/npc/opponent has the following action options:
-- Attack (Using Brawl or Firearms);
-- Perform Maneuver;
-- Flee;
-- Cast a Spell;
-- Other Actions;

A "maneuver" is an act other than simply inflicting damage (See 'rule combat maneuver')
"Other Actions" refer to any other action outside the fighting that require some time to execute;

If Attack is chosen, a opposite roll of skills takes place, comparing the level of sucess of each player.

- Once an attack is perfomed, the defender can choose to:
-- Dodge (Using Dogde): In draw, defender wins/No damage is inflicted;
-- Fight Back (Using Fighting): If draw, initiator wins. If both fail, no damage is inflicted;
-- Maneuver (Same as fight back, but instead of inflicting damage, apply the manuever;
