Spells Checklist:

1 - Casting a spell for the first time requires a Hard POW roll:
-- If pass -> Spell happens and is learned
-- If fails -> Nothing happens, the investigator didn't learn the spell, else push.
-- If push fails: **dire consequences**, but the spell is still cast.
-- If push not attempted: investigator needs to relearn the spell: Hard INT roll + 2D6 weeks of study

2 - Once cast, the investigator can always use spell:
-- Deduct Sanity and Magic Points and other costs;
-- Do rolls as required by the spell;

3 - Dire consequences:
-- Determine if normal or powerful spell;
-- Apply normal cost times 1D6
